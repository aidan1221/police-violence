# police-violence
Project repo for PSU CS 510 Explorations In Data Science term projects - Summer 2020


## Research Project Plan
##### Chasity Savella & Aidan Wolfe
**Project Objective (1-2 sentences)**:
 - We hope to execute the implementation option for this project
    - Objective 1 - We intend to create a heat map using police violence data and census data, to demonstrate which states experience police violence most disproportionately directed towards Black communities.
    - Objective 2 - We also hope to look at a time based comparison of police killings before protests vs during BLM protests/some time after protests began.

**Project Approach (1-2 paragraphs)**:

- To begin, we are going to download and gather the necessary data for both objectives. Objective 1 and objective 2 both rely heavily on the police violence database referenced above. Objective 1 will also require attaining census racial demographic data for each state (as recent as possible) and researching how to generate a heat map. Currently, we are exploring options with plotlyâ€™s python choropleth map library.
 Once data and tools are both in hand and understood, we will generate the images to support objectives 1 and 2 above, and then develop an analysis of these images and a discussion of the data to go along with our final presentation.


**Team Structure (3-4 sentences)**:
- Chasity:
    - Slide guru
    - Objective 2
    - Data exploration and processing
- Aidan:
    - Heat map exploration
    - Objective 1
    - Data exploration and processing

**Milestones (~5 milestones)**:
 - Gather all data (7/11)
    - Mapping Police Violence Database
    - Find good census data (recent, broken down by state & race)
 - Have draft visualisations (7/18)
    - Maybe try making a heat map or something
 - 8/1 - have visualisations done
    - Begin working on slides and analysis
 - 8/8 - finalize presentation
